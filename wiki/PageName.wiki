What you need:

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS - CC1110DK-MINI-868 - CC1110, WIRELESS, MINI DEV KIT

Costs around Â£55, but you could split it in 2 and sell the second part


DO NOT GET THE FOLLOWING:

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS - CC1110EMK868-915 - CC1110 RF TRANSCEIVER, EVAL MODULE

It might, but it will be very difficult to work with.
I know, I made this mistake at first, and had to return it.


--------------------------------

Flash the firmware (.hex) to the chip using the provided flasher tool

--------------------------------

Solder 3 wires as such:

Black is Ground

Blue is   Devkit Rx, PC tx

Yellow is DevKit Tx, PC Rx


Attach the wires to a serial port, or scope them with a logic analyser, like the Salaea tool.
