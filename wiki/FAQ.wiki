Q: How do I pronounce it?

A: Same way you pronounce "Z-Wave":

If you like "Zed Wave" then say "Zed Tsunami".

If you like "Zee Wave" then say "Zee Tsunami".

Q: Didn't you violate TI/Z-Wave alliance trust?

A: I do not have access the official spec, which cost thousands of Â£/$. 
I do not know anybody who has, I just researched on the Internet, and bought Dr. Christian Paetz book "Z-Wave Basics" ISBN 9781490537368

I also did not sign any NDA.

Q:Isn't it very similar to z-force

A: YES! I created zTsunami as I love Z-Wave, but kept being frustrated by the controllers. I have a Micasaverde, a Fibaro HC2, and a razberry. A colleague of mine (not z-wave related work) has a USB zwave controller too, and frankly they all suck. So I started sniffing the razberry. but I found it had too many undocumented proprietary packets. then I found z-force, and thought I could use it as a controller. But after I received the devkit, I found out, there were too many issues: Source was not available, and the firmware binaries were not compatible with the flashing tool I had. So I decided to write my own.
