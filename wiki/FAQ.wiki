Q: How do I pronounce it?

A: Same way you pronounce "Z-Wave":

If you like "Zed Wave" then say "Zed Tsunami".

If you like "Zee Wave" then say "Zee Tsunami".

---------------

Q: Why the name "zTsunami" ?

A: It's a play on the Z-Wave name: Tsunami is a largest kind of wave.

If you have been affected in anyway by a tsunami, please don't take offense. It is not my aim.

--------------

Q: Didn't you violate TI and/or Z-Wave alliance trust?

A: I do not have access the official spec, which cost thousands of Â£/$. 
I do not know anybody who has, I just researched on the Internet, and bought Dr. Christian Paetz book "Z-Wave Basics" ISBN 9781490537368

I also did not sign any NDA.

------------------

Q:Isn't it very similar to z-force

http://research.sensepost.com/tools/embedded/zforce

https://code.google.com/p/z-force/

A: YES! I created zTsunami as I love Z-Wave, but kept being frustrated by the controllers. I have a Micasaverde, a Fibaro HC2, and a razberry. A colleague of mine (not z-wave related work) has a USB zwave controller too, and frankly they all suck. So I started sniffing the razberry. but I found it had too many undocumented proprietary packets. then I found z-force, and thought I could use it as a controller. But after I received the devkit, I found out, there were too many issues: Source was not available, and the firmware binaries were not compatible with the flashing tool I had. So I decided to write my own.

--------------------

Q: Will you add a feature for me?

A: Maybe. If you don't ask, you don't get.

But:

- I do not develop this project for a living, so it might not happen right away.

- If I deem a feature is just evil, I probably won't. But you can still code it yourself.

--------------------------

Q: Can I contribute?

A: YES! You can submit code changes. There is a lot to improve.

You can also give me a donation through paypal if you like it.

--------------------------

Q: Can I use use it in a commercial project.

A: YES, For free! but you MUST link to this project web-page in the user manual, or provide a document that point to it with the product.

-----------------

Q: Are you interested to know about my project that uses zTsunami?

A: YES. I'll be glad to know of any project that uses it.

------------------

Q: Will you build me one?

A: I could, but honestly, if you can't solder 3 wires, and flash a firmware following instructions, you will not get the best of this project.
