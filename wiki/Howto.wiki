What you need:

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS - CC1110DK-MINI-868 - CC1110, WIRELESS, MINI DEV KIT

Costs around Â£55, but you could split it in 2 and sell the second part


DO NOT GET THE FOLLOWING:

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS - CC1110EMK868-915 - CC1110 RF TRANSCEIVER, EVAL MODULE

It might work, but it will be very difficult.
I know, I made this mistake at first, and had to return it.


--------------------------------

Flash the firmware (Source Tab, Browse, Trunk/ztsunamiFW/zTsunami.hex) to the chip using the provided USB flasher tool and "TI SmartRF Flash Programmer Software"

--------------------------------

Solder 3 wires as such:

Black is Ground

Blue is   Devkit Rx, PC Tx

Yellow is DevKit Tx, PC Rx


Attach the wires to a serial port, or scope them with a logic analyser, like the Saleae ( https://www.saleae.com/ ) tool.

Launch a serial terminal (Tera Term ( http://ttssh2.sourceforge.jp/index.html.en ) for example)

Select correct port, Set bitrate to 115200

----------------------------------

As of v0.1 the firmware is being developed using Keil C51 v9.5.2
( http://www.keil.com/c51/c51.asp )

With the demo license it is limited to 2KB of code.

So it is likely the toolchain change to SDCC ( http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ ) in the future.

You don't need these tools if you plan to use the unmodified ztsunami default firmware: just flash the .hex file provided
